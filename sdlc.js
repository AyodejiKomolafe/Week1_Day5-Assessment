// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

Planning

Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the process of determining what the project is supposed to do and what it requires by analyzing the resources needed for the project. "
const design = "This entails knowing how the application will work, its architecture which specifies the languages to be used,user interface which enatils how users will interact with the application , platforms the application will be run, programmming, communication of the application with other assets and security of the application"
const Implementation = "This is the process of writing the program, implementing the already analyzed requirements. this also entail fixing glitches and errors etc."
const testingAndItegration = "This involves testing the application before deploying it to end users, it is important to do this in order to get a hang of things and make sure all is well with the application, after this is done then the application can be deployed to consumers."
const maintain = "At this point the application is being used by consumers, this step of the development cycle is just as important as the others, it entails fixing of bugs, making updates or changes to the program etc."
